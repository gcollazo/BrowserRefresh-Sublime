# Browser Refresh for Sublime Text 2

After installing this plugin you can hit `command + shift + r` on Mac OS X or `ctrl + shift + r` on Windows while using  **Sublime Text 2** and your **Google Chrome**, **Safari**, **Firefox** or **Opera** window will come to the foreground *(optional in Chrome and Safari)* and reload the active tab. If the current file is unsaved, it will be saved before the browser is activated and reloaded.

## Settings
To edit settings go to `Preferences > Package Settings > Browser Refresh`

```json
[
    {
        "keys": ["command+shift+r"], "command": "browser_refresh", "args": {
            "auto_save": true,
            "delay": 0.5,
            "activate_browser": true,
            "browser_name" : "Google Chrome"
        }
    }
]
```
`auto_save` - If set to `true` you current file in Sublime Text will be save before refreshing the browser window.

`delay` - Adds a delay (in seconds) before triggering the refresh. Seems to be useful if you are using a CSS or JavaScript pre-processor. The default is 0.0 seconds. 

`activate_browser` - If set to `true` when you press the keys it will bring the browser to the foreground.

`browser_name` - Specify which browser to use. The default is `Google Chrome` but you can change it to `Safari`,`Firefox`, `Opera` or `all` which will try to refresh any of the above present in your system.


## Requirements
Currently it only works on **Mac OS X** and **Windows 7** with **Google Chrome**, **Safari**, **Firefox** and **Opera**. I don't really plan to extend it for now. If you want to make it better, please feel free to fork and request a pull.
