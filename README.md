#Browser Refresh for Sublime Text 2

After installing this plugin you can hit `command + shift + r` on any window in **Sublime Text 2** and you **Google Chrome** window will come to the foreground and reload the active tab. If the current file is unsaved, it will be saved before Chrome is activated and reloaded.

##Requirements
Currenty it only works on **Mac OS X** with **Google Chrome**. I don't really plan to extend it for now. If you want to make it better, please feel free to fork and request a pull.

##How to install
Just clone this repo to your **Packages** folder
