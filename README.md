# Browser Refresh for Sublime Text

After installing this plugin you can hit `command + shift + r` on Mac OS X or `ctrl + shift + r` on Windows and Linux while using your favorite browser, the last active window will come to the foreground *(you can turn this off in Chrome, Canary, Safari, WebKit and Yandex on Mac)* and reload the active tab. If the current file is unsaved, it will be saved before the browser is activated and reloaded.

### 1. Install the package
**With the Package Control plugin**
The easiest way to install **Browser Refresh** is through Package Control, which can be found at [http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).

```
Using Package Manager search for "Browser Refresh"
```

**Without Git**
Download the latest source from GitHub and copy the BrowserRefresh folder to your Sublime Text "Packages" directory.

**With Git**
Clone the repository in your Sublime Text "Packages" directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/gcollazo/BrowserRefresh-Sublime.git "Browser Refresh"
```

#### 1.1 On Linux
Install xdotool:

```
sudo apt-get install xdotool
```

### 2. Configure Key Bindings
You need to add the following to your `Key Bindings - User`. Go to `Preferences > Key Bindings - User` and add the following to that file and save. Without this step the plugin will not work.

```json
[
    {
        "keys": ["command+shift+r"], "command": "browser_refresh", "args": {
            "auto_save": true,
            "delay": 0.5,
            "activate_browser": true,
            "browser_name" : "all"
        }
    }
]
```

**auto_save**
If set to `true` you current file in Sublime Text will be saved before refreshing the browser window.

**delay**
Adds a delay (in seconds) before triggering the refresh. Seems to be useful if you are using a CSS or JavaScript pre-processor. The default is 0.0 seconds.

**activate_browser**
If set to `true` when you press the keys it will bring the browser to the foreground. **Note:** On Windows this setting is always `true`.

**browser_name**
Specify which browser to use. The default is `all` which will try to refresh all running browser on your system. You can change to be more specific: `Google Chrome`, `Google Chrome Canary`, `Safari`, `WebKit`, `Firefox`, `Firefox Developer Edition`, `Opera`, `IE`, `Iron`, `Yandex`, `Pale Moon`.

**Note**: on Windows use `Google Chrome` if you want to use Canary, because at the moment it's very hard to distinguish between them as both report themselves as Chrome. This also means that if you have both Chrome and Canary running, it will refresh the active tab on both browsers.

**Simple Trick**
Nearly 90% of the time this plugin would be used for Front-End development in which case you would have to save a file to see the change, so setting this plugin's keyboard shortcut to CTRL+S and CTRL+S, meaning you press CTRL+S twice repeatedly would just make your life a little easier. The first time you press CTRL+S the file will be save and the second time it will be opened in the browser of your choice. 
You can do this by changing:
```json
"keys": ["command+shift+r"], "command": "browser_refresh", "args": {
    // Rest of the Code
}
```
TO
```json
"keys": ["ctrl+s", "ctrl+s"], "command": "browser_refresh", "args": {
    // Rest of the Code
}
```
