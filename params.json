{"name":"BrowserRefresh-sublime","tagline":"Save the file you are working on and refresh your browser with one keystroke","body":"# Browser Refresh for Sublime Text 2\r\n\r\nAfter installing this plugin you can hit `command + shift + r` on any window in **Sublime Text 2** and your **Google Chrome**, **Safari**, **Firefox** or **Opera** window will come to the foreground *(optional in Chrome and Safari)* and reload the active tab. If the current file is unsaved, it will be saved before the browser is activated and reloaded.\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\nTo edit settings go to `Preferences > Package Settings > Browser Refresh`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        \"keys\": [\"command+shift+r\"], \"command\": \"browser_refresh\", \"args\": {\r\n            \"auto_save\": true,\r\n            \"delay\": 0.5,\r\n            \"activate_browser\": true,\r\n            \"browser_name\" : \"Google Chrome\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n`auto_save` - If se to `true` you current file in Sublime Text will be save before refreshing the browser window.\r\n\r\n`delay` - Adds a delay (in seconds) before triggering the refresh. Seems to be useful if you are using a CSS or JavaScript pre-processor. The default is 0.0 seconds. \r\n\r\n`activate_browser` - If set to `true` when you press the keys it will bring the browser to the foreground.\r\n\r\n`browser_name` - Specify which browser to use. The default is `Google Chrome` but you can change it to `Safari`,`Firefox`, `Opera` or `all` which will try to refresh any of the above present in your system.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nCurrently it only works on **Mac OS X** with **Google Chrome**, **Safari**, **Firefox** and **Opera**. I don't really plan to extend it for now. If you want to make it better, please feel free to fork and request a pull.\r\n\r\n## How to install\r\n**With the Package Control plugin:** The easiest way to install BrowserRefresh is through Package Control, which can be found at [http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)\r\n\r\n**Without Git:** Download the latest source from GitHub and copy the BrowserRefresh folder to your Sublime Text \"Packages\" directory.\r\n\r\n**With Git:** Clone the repository in your Sublime Text \"Packages\" directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:gcollazo/BrowserRefresh-Sublime.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\nAll of Browser Refresh for Sublime Text 2 is licensed under the MIT license.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Giovanni Collazo\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
